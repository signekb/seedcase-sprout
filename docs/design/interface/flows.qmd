::: callout-important
We created this document mainly as a way to help us as a team all
understand and agree on what we're making and what needs to be worked
on. This means that the flows may change quite substantially until we've
reached a stable full release at `v1.0.0`.
:::

Based on the [functions](functions.qmd#functions) page that lists and
describes the main functions and classes that make up the interface in
detail including their input and output, this document describes and
shows how all these objects work together and flow into one another.

Each diagram uses specific shapes and lines to represent different
things:

-   A dotted line between objects/functions means the flow is optional.
-   A solid line between objects/functions means the flow is required
    and is the next step.
-   A cylinder means an object such as a class or file.
-   A rectangle with rounded corners means an action like a function or
    method.

like Firefox. To see them, try using a different browser like Chrome or
Edge.

## Creating or updating a package

This is the flow for making a new package. The `write_properties()`
function will internally call `check_properties()`, but this can also be
called separately to check the properties before writing them to the
`datapackage.json` file. The `PackageProperties` input is imported from
a Python script in the `scripts/` folder of the data package. To update
the properties in the `datapackage.json` file, you would edit the Python
script with the properties directly and then rerun your main script to
overwrite the `datapackage.json` file with the new properties.

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-flow-new-package
%%| fig-cap: "Diagram showing the flow of objects and functions to create a new package."
%%| fig-alt: "A flow diagram showing the steps to making a new package."
flowchart
    properties[(PackageProperties)]
    path_properties("PackagePath().properties()")
    check_properties("check_properties()")
    write_properties("write_properties()")

    properties -.-> check_properties
    properties --> write_properties
    path_properties --> write_properties
```

## Extracting resource properties from data

The flow for extracting resource properties from data. This is useful
when the data is in a format that contains metadata about the data, such
as a CSV file with a header row that contains the column names. The
`extract_resource_properties()` function cannot extract all required
properties from the data, so both `TableSchemaProperties` and
`ResourceProperties` will need many of their fields filled in after
extraction. The output of the `extract_resource_properties()` function
can be used to generate a Python script to give you a starting point for
writing the resource properties. Afterwards, if you want to update the
resource properties, you'll edit this Python script and then re-run your
build process to generate the `datapackage.json` file with the updated
properties.

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-flow-extract-resource-properties
%%| fig-cap: "Diagram showing the flow of objects and functions to extract resource properties from data."
%%| fig-alt: "A flow diagram showing the steps to extract resource properties from data."
flowchart
    data[("DataFrame<br>(Tidy)")]
    properties_extracted[("ResourceProperties<br>(extracted)")]
    extract_resource_properties("extract_resource_properties()")
    python_script("Python script<br>(generated with<br>extracted properties)")

    data --> extract_resource_properties
    extract_resource_properties --> properties_extracted
    properties_extracted --> python_script
```

## Updating README after changing package or resource properties

The flow for updating the README file after changing the package or
resource properties. Since the README template text is generated from
the properties in the `datapackage.json` file, any change to that file
will require updating the README file. The split between
`as_readme_text()` and `write_file()` is to allow for testing or
programmatically modifying the generated README text before writing it
to the file.

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-flow-update-readme
%%| fig-cap: "Diagram showing the flow of objects and functions to update the README file after changing the package or resource properties."
%%| fig-alt: "A flow diagram showing the steps to update the README file after changing the package or resource properties."
flowchart
    properties[(PackageProperties)]
    path_properties("PackagePath().properties()")
    read_properties("read_properties()")
    as_readme_text("as_readme_text()")
    write_file("write_file()")
    path_readme("PackagePath().readme()")

    path_properties --> read_properties
    read_properties --> properties
    properties --> as_readme_text
    as_readme_text --> write_file
    path_readme --> write_file
```

## Checking the properties of packages or resources

The flow to check the `datapackage.json` file's properties is fairly
simple. You check `PackageProperties` (with or without resources) using
either the `check_properties()` function or the
`check_package_properties()` function. You check a specific resource's
`ResourceProperties` with the `check_resource_properties()` function.
All these functions are customised wrappers around a generic
`_check_properties()` function, which uses arguments to decide which
properties to check. The `_check_properties()` function is itself a
wrapper around our `check_datapackage` "sub-package" (which we intend to
split into its own package later).

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-flow-check-properties
%%| fig-cap: "Diagram showing the flow of objects and functions to check the properties of packages or resources."
%%| fig-alt: "A flow diagram showing the steps to check the properties of packages or resources."
flowchart
    properties[(PackageProperties)]
    check_properties("check_properties()")
    check_package_properties("check_package_properties()")
    resource_properties[(ResourceProperties)]
    check_resource_properties("check_resource_properties()")

    properties --> check_properties
    properties --> check_package_properties
    resource_properties --> check_resource_properties
```

## Saving new or modified data to batch

A data resource needs data, not just properties. You can add data to any
data resource that has resource properties. Whenever data is added to a
data resource, it gets first saved in the `batch/` folder to keep track
of additions or changes. You add the data when:

-   A new data resource is created and data is added to it.
-   Additional data is added to an existing data resource.
-   You need to fix, update, or modify existing data in the resource by
    correcting the data (e.g. fixing a data entry issue).

The data must be in a tidy format and must have already been loaded in
as a Polars DataFrame.

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-flow-save-data-to-batch
%%| fig-cap: "Diagram showing the flow of objects and functions to save new, added, or modified data to a batch."
%%| fig-alt: "A flow diagram showing the steps to save new, added, or modified data to a batch."
flowchart
    data[("DataFrame<br>(original data)")]
    resource_properties[(ResourceProperties)]
    write_resource_batch("write_resource_batch()")
    check_data("check_data()")

    data --> write_resource_batch
    resource_properties --> write_resource_batch
    data -.-> check_data
    resource_properties -.-> check_data
```

## Checking data against the properties

The data must always match what is described in the properties. This
means that the data must have the same column names, column types, and
column constraints. The `check_data()` function will internally call
several separate functions for these specific checks. Each of these
functions outputs an error message describing what the problems are if
the check fails. Otherwise, the input data frame is returned unchanged.

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-flow-check-data-against-properties
%%| fig-cap: "Diagram showing the flow of objects and functions to check data against the properties."
%%| fig-alt: "A flow diagram showing the steps to check data against the properties."

    data[(DataFrame)]
    resource_properties[(ResourceProperties)]
    check_data("check_data()")
    subgraph Internal
        check_column_names("_check_column_names()")
        check_column_types("_check_column_types()")
        check_column_values_constraints("_check_column_values_constraints()")
        output[("DataFrame<br>or error")]
    end

    data --> check_data
    resource_properties --> check_data
    check_data -.-> Internal
    check_column_names -.-> output
    check_column_types -.-> output
    check_column_values_constraints -.-> output
    style Internal fill:#ffffff
```

## Creating or re-creating the resource data

The batch data files are used to keep track of changes to the data. The
data that will be used is kept clean and ready for analysis, while
original data is not deleted. This flow converts batch data into the
final resource data file. The steps are split up so that, if needed or
desired, you can make modifications to the data before it is written to
the final resource data. While `write_resource_data()` will call
`check_data()` internally, this can also be called separately to check
the data before writing it to the final resource data.

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-flow-create-resource-data
%%| fig-cap: "Diagram showing the flow of objects and functions to create or re-create the resource data."
%%| fig-alt: "A flow diagram showing the steps to create or re-create the resource data."

    read_resource_batches("read_resource_batches()")
    list_data[("List[DataFrame]")]
    join_resource_batches("join_resource_batches()")
    joined_data[(DataFrame)]
    write_resource_data("write_resource_data()")
    resource_properties[(ResourceProperties)]
    check_data("check_data()")

    path_resource_batch_files --> read_resource_batches
    read_resource_batches --> list_data
    list_data --> join_resource_batches
    join_resource_batches --> joined_data
    joined_data --> write_resource_data
    resource_properties --> write_resource_data
    joined_data -.-> check_data
    resource_properties -.-> check_data
```

## Modifying data types or table schema

Sometimes you may need to modify the data types or table schema of the
data in a resource. Before using this flow, you first need to modify the
resource properties. The `update_resource_batches()` function will
update each batch DataFrame with the new data types or table schema.
Then, you can use `write_resource_batch()` to save the updated data back
to the batch files. The same file names should be used to overwrite old
batch files.

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-flow-modify-data-types
%%| fig-cap: "Diagram showing the flow of objects and functions to modify data types or table schema."
%%| fig-alt: "A flow diagram showing the steps to modify data types or table schema."
flowchart
    path_resource_batch_files("path_resource_batch_files()")
    read_resource_batches("read_resource_batches()")
    properties_updated[("ResourceProperties<br>(updated)")]
    list_data[("List[DataFrame]")]
    list_data_updated[("List[DataFrame]<br>(updated)")]
    update_resource_batches("update_resource_batches()")
    write_resource_batch("write_resource_batch()")

    path_resource_batch_files --> read_resource_batches
    read_resource_batches --> list_data
    list_data --> update_resource_batches
    properties_updated --> update_resource_batches
    update_resource_batches --> list_data_updated
    list_data_updated --> write_resource_batch
    properties_updated --> write_resource_batch
```

## Deleting an observational unit

If you need to delete an observational unit from the data, you can use
this flow. The `delete_observational_unit()` function will delete the
observational unit from the data and output a list of DataFrames with
the deletions. The `write_resource_batch()` function will save the
updated data back to the batch files.

<!-- TODO: I don't know how the saving back to the batch files will work yet. -->

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-flow-delete-observational-unit
%%| fig-cap: "Diagram showing the flow of objects and functions to delete an observational unit."
%%| fig-alt: "A flow diagram showing the steps to delete an observational unit."

    list_data_deletions[("List[DataFrame]<br>(deletions)")]
    obs_unit[("dict<br>(observational unit)")]
    delete_observational_unit("delete_observational_unit()")
    write_resource_batch("write_resource_batch()")

    path_resource_batch_files --> read_resource_batches
    read_resource_batches --> list_data_current
    list_data_current --> delete_observational_unit
    obs_unit --> delete_observational_unit
    delete_observational_unit --> list_data_deletions
    list_data_deletions --> write_resource_batch
    path_resource_batch_files --> write_resource_batch
```
