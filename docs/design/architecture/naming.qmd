title: "Naming"
---

This document describes a general naming scheme for Sprout that is
guided by our [style guide](https://design.seedcase-project.org/style/)
as well as by the [Frictionless
Framework](https://v4.framework.frictionlessdata.io/) and [Data
Package](https://datapackage.org/) structure. This naming scheme *only*
applies to data objects, functions, URLs, API endpoints, and command
line interfaces that are exposed to or associated with user-facing
content. It does *not* apply to internal content; see the style guide
for details on naming internal (developer-facing) content.

We'll compose names based on the objects we and our users interact with
as well as the actions taken on those objects. Following along with the
[Frictionless Data Package](https://datapackage.org/) terminology, we
simplify "data package" to "package" and "data resource" to "resource".
We use the words "property" or "properties" to describe package and
resource metadata contained in the `datapackage.json` file that follows
the Frictionless Data specification.

::: callout-important
While we use the term "properties" to mean anything related to the
metadata contained within the `datapackage.json` file, the Frictionless
Data Package specification uses the term
["descriptor"](https://datapackage.org/standard/glossary/#descriptor) to
describe metadata as the structure of the properties (the metadata as a
whole) and as the file itself. Since we mainly create, modify, or delete
properties not descriptors and since we want to minimize using and
introducing additional terms, for simplicity we use "properties" to refer to
the content of the `datapackage.json` file rather than its structure.
We may also occasionally use "properties" to refer to the file itself.

## Objects

| Object | Description |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| package(s) | A data package that contains a collection of related data resources and properties. |
| resource(s) | A single data file within a package, along with its properties and associated batch data files. |
| properties | Metadata about a package or resource. |
| path | A file path listing the location of folders or files that Sprout interacts with. |
| data | The data file within a resource. Within Sprout, this includes the Parquet data and batch files. |
| identifier | A unique identifier for a package (*only for server environments*) or resource, denoted as `id`. |
| changes | The changes made to the data package that will be stored in the version control repository of the data package. |
| version | The version of the data package, denoted as `version`. |
| observational unit | The unit of observation, meaning the data associated with a specific entity at a specific time, e.g. a person who had their weight measured on their 30th birthday. |

: General objects used throughout Sprout.

| File or folder | Description |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| dirs | A shortened name for folder or directory. |
| packages | The folder that contains all packages. *Only for server environments*. |
| resources | The folder that contains all resource files in a package. |
| batch | The folder that contains the batch data files for a data resource (timestamped data when first added (or updated) to a resource). |
| JSON | The main way we save and pass information around on the package's or resource's properties. |
| Parquet | A columnar, efficient storage file format that we use to save data within a resource, but as the final resource as well as a batch file when the data was first added or updated to the resource. |

: Specific files and folders used within or output by Sprout.

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| commit | Saves changes made in a data package to the version control system. |
| build | Build means generating or re-generating an object from other objects, e.g. (re-)build the text for the README. |
| update | Update an object, mainly of the properties or version objects. |
| write | Write an object to a file. |
| read | Reads an object from a file. |
| delete | Permanently delete a file(s) associated with an object (e.g. delete a whole package or observational unit). |
| extract | Extract specific information from an object, specifically the properties from a data file. |

: General actions that Sprout can take on objects or files/folders.
