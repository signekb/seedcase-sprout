title: "Naming"
---

This document describes a general naming scheme for Sprout that is
guided by our [style guide](https://design.seedcase-project.org/style/)
as well as by the [Frictionless
Framework](https://v4.framework.frictionlessdata.io/) and [Data
Package](https://datapackage.org/) structure. This naming scheme *only*
applies to data objects, functions, URLs, API endpoints, and command
line interfaces that are exposed to or associated with user-facing
content. It does *not* apply to internal content; see the style guide
for details on naming internal (developer-facing) content.

We'll compose names based on the objects we and our users interact with
as well as the actions taken on those objects. Following along with the
[Frictionless Data Package](https://datapackage.org/) terminology, we
simplify "data package" to "package" and "data resource" to "resource".
We use the words "property" or "properties" to describe package and
resource metadata contained in the `datapackage.json` file that follows
the Frictionless Data specification.

::: callout-important
While we use the term "properties" to mean anything related to the
metadata contained within the `datapackage.json` file, the Frictionless
Data Package specification uses the term
["descriptor"](https://datapackage.org/standard/glossary/#descriptor) to
describe metadata as the structure of the properties (the metadata as a
whole) and as the file itself. Since we mainly create, modify, or delete
properties not descriptors and since we want to minimize using and
introducing additional terms, for simplicity we use "properties" to refer to
the content of the `datapackage.json` file rather than its structure.
We may also occasionally use "properties" to refer to the file itself.

## Objects

| Object | Description |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| package(s) | A data package that contains a collection of related data resources and properties. |
| resource(s) | A single data file within a package, along with its properties and associated *raw* data files. |
| properties or property | Metadata about a package or resource. |
| file structure or structure | The file and folder structure of a package. |
| path | A file path listing the location of folders or files that Sprout interacts with. |
| data | The data file within a resource. Within Sprout, this includes the Parquet file and raw files. |
| identifier | A unique identifier for a package or resource, denoted as `id`. |

: General objects used throughout Sprout.

| File or folder | Description |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| packages | The folder that contains all packages. |
| resources | The folder that contains all resource files in a package. |
| raw | The folder that contains raw data files for a data resource. |
| raw data file | A compressed raw data file format, such as a `.zip`, `.gzip`, or `.tar.gz` file. |
| JSON | The main way we save and pass information around on the package's or resource's properties. |
| Parquet | A columnar, efficient storage file format that we use to save data within a resource. |

: Specific files and folders used within or output by Sprout.

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| create | Create a new object. |
| build | Build implies either creating a new object or recreating an existing one, e.g. (re-)build a file like the README or Parquet file. |
| view | View details about an object. |
| list | List basic details about many objects. |
| edit | Edit an object, specifically the properties object. |
| add | Add another object to an existing object, specifically adding data to a resource. |
| write | Write an object to a file. |
| copy | Copy a file from one location to another. |
| delete | Permanently delete an object. |
| extract | Extract specific information from an object, specifically the properties from a data file. |

: General actions that Sprout can take on objects or files/folders.
