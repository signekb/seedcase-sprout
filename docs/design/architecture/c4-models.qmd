title: "C4 Models"

This section contains the [C4 Models](https://c4model.com/) for Sprout.
The C4 Model is an established visualization approach to describe the
architecture of a software system. It breaks the system down into four
levels of architectural abstraction: Context, Containers, Components, and Code. The
last level is rarely used nor recommended for most software architecture
since it is used to visualize a high degree of detail that most projects
don't need. Below are the diagrams for the **Context**, **Containers**, and
**Components** (the last of which includes three diagrams).

## Context

The Context diagram shows the users and any external
systems that interact with Sprout. This includes the three user roles *data contributor*, *project admin* and *project owner* described in the [users](user-roles.qmd) post.

## Container

The Container diagram shows the larger parts of the system, what they
are responsible for, and how they interact with each other. It also shows
the technology choices for each container.

## Component

The Component model offers a more detailed view of the system into what
the smaller parts are that make up an individual container and that
allow it to fulfill its responsibilities. There are three diagrams for
the components: the user interface, the (internal) management,
and the databases and storage.

### User interface

This diagram shows the pages users interact with in the user interface container. In addition, it shows which user roles that can access them. Outside the container is the authentication container and the management container. The authentication container is needed to authenticate users and their access.

### Management

This diagram shows the actions and behaviours that happen internally between the user interface and the database and storage. This includes things like creating databases, updating data and metadata, and modifying user roles.

### Databases and storage

This diagram shows the components that make up the database and storage container, and the types of actions and behaviours they have.
