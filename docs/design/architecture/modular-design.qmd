title: "Modular design"
---

While we describe how we implement aspects of modular design across all
Seedcase products in our [design
documentation](https://design.seedcase-project.org), this document
explains this split between Python code, CLI, web app, and web API in
the context of Sprout.

## Python modules

In order to achieve our aims, the main functionality is designed and
implemented as a Python package and can be used as a Python package.
This code is stored in the Python module (folder location)
`sprout/core/` and is accessible via the Python code
`import sprout.core` statement. Only external-facing functions would be
exposed to the user and to other programs.

Any extensions would then only need to incorporate and depend on the
`sprout.core` package to get Sprout's functionality. Each extension
would be its own module within Sprout, with modules named like
`sprout/extension_name/`, for instance, `sprout/cli/`. That way, within
the extension's module, the logic that we implement is only specific to
creating the CLI and not to the actual functionality of Sprout.

Other potential extensions would follow the same or similar pattern.
This allows other developers to create their own extensions and
interfaces to Sprout that suit their particular needs.

Our [Guide](../../guide/index.qmd) has examples and tutorials on how
each split is used.

-   For our CLI, it is placed in the module `sprout/cli/`. Each command
    imports the relevant functions from `sprout.core`, along with
    decorators (from other Python packages) to convert the Python code
    into a CLI program.

-   The web app is in `sprout/app/`. Each page of the web app imports
    the required functions from `sprout.core`, with functions from other
    Python packages that convert that code into a web app.

-   The web API is in `sprout/api/`. Each endpoint imports the required
    functions from `sprout.core` with functions from other Python
    packages that convert that code into a web API. This particular
    module may not be necessary as many Python packages that create web
    apps are also able to easily create web APIs from the same or
    slightly modified code.
