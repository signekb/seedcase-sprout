{{< include /docs/includes/_wip.qmd >}}

Within the design documentation are two main sections:

-   [Architecture](architecture/index.qmd): The architecture section
    describes the high-level requirements, components, use cases,
    expected users, and how the system will be organized and deployed.
-   [Implementation](implementation/index.qmd): The implementation
    section describes a much more detailed description of how we will
    implement the architectural design. The detail is at the level of
    exact Python functions, CLI commands, and the app endpoints and
    pages.
