This document describes the user flow of Sprout. The user flow is split into five diagrams that go through the flow in more detail. At the end of the document, you can see the user flow of Sprout in its entirety.

In this document, we will mention different user roles. Go to the [Users](users.qmd) post for definitions of user roles. 

<!-- TODO: Add more of an overall introduction to what the user flow of sprout entails before going into each part -->

## Table Metadata Creation 

The first step of uploading data to Sprout is to create a table for the data. Users with the role [Data Management Administrators](users.qmd#data-management-administrators) are responsible for setting up these initial structures of the database. 

Table metadata includes:

- Table name
- Original file name
- Description (A short description of what data the table contains)
- Created by (ID of user creating the table)
- Created at (timestamp of when the table was created)
- Modified by (ID of user modifying the table; if table hasn't been modified this is NULL)
- Modified at (timestamp fo when the table was modified; if table hasn't been modified this is NULL)

Below, we show an example of how the table metadata is stored for a table named `table_1` in a data resource that has not been modified: 

| table_id | table | original_file_name | description | created_by | created_at | modified_at | modified_by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `table_1` | `table_1.csv` | This table contains user information | 1 | 2024-01-01 08:00:00 | NULL | NULL |

: Example of table metadata for `table_1`

A [Data Management Administrator](users.qmd#data-management-administrators) only needs to write the table name and description. The remaining information is extracted by Sprout behind the scenes. 

Whenever a new table metadata is added, Sprout will check whether a table with the exact same name already exists. It will not be possible to create a table with a name that already exists, and the user will be asked to write a different name for the table.

![Diagram of the flow that occurs when table metadata is created.](images/user-flow-table-metadata-creation.png)

After a table's metadata has been created, the next step is to define the columns within the table. Column metadata includes:

- Column name (machine-readable column name, textbox)
- Title (human-readable column name, textbox, optional)
- Data type (choose data type from a list available data types, dropdown), 
- A short description (a sentence describing what the column contains, textbox)
- Allow missing (whether missing values are allowed in the column, boolean, i.e., yes/no or 1/0)
- Allow duplication (whether duplicate values are allowed in the column, boolean, i.e., yes/no or 1/0)

Below, we show an example of column metadata for columns describing users in `table_1`:

|table_metadata | column-name | title | description | data_type | allow_missing_value | allow_duplicate_value
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `1` | `user_id` | `User ID` | Unique ID identifying the user | `int` | 0 | 0 |
| `1` | `user_name` | `Username` | User's username | `int` | 0 | 0 |
| `1` | `last_name` | `Last Name` | User's last name | `varchar` | 0 | 1 |
| `1` | `first_name` | `First Name` | User's first name | `varchar` | 0 | 1 |
| `1` | `email` | `Email` | User's email address | `int` | 0 | 0 |

In Sprout, there are four ways to create column metadata: 

- Create Column Metadata from File
- Create Column Metadata from Table Metadata File
- Create Column Metadata from Existing Table
- Create Column Metadata Manually

### Create Table from File with Data

The first option is to create a table from a file with data of the wanted structure. In this workflow, a file is selected to extract column metadata from. Sprout will check whether the selected file is a supported file type and extract the metadata from the columns in the file.

### Create Table from Column Metadata File

The second option is to create a table from a file describing the column metadata. This is similar to the workflow described above except that the selected file is a file containing the column metadata instead of raw data.

### Create Table from Existing Table 

The third option is to create a table from an existing table. This includes choosing an existing table as a "base table" for the [Data Management Administrator](users.qmd#data-management-administrators) to build a new table from.

### Create Table Manually

The fourth option is to create a table manually. In this scenario, the [Data Management Administrator](users.qmd#data-management-administrators) will add headers and definitions of the table manully.

<!--TODO SKB 19 January 2024: This is where I got to in the update of this post. It will probably change again, so I will stop this update for now and return at a later stage-->

## Validation Check: Table Completeness

When the initial table has been created, Sprout will complete a validation check, "Table Completeness". This check identifies whether all headers/column names have definitions. 

If there are missing fields (e.g., a column is missing a data type), the validation will fail. "Validation failed" will be shown on a user interface together with the table. 

::: {.callout-note}
When a table is created using a file, the *description* fields will initially be empty, since descriptions of headers are not within the file itself. By ensuring that [Data Management Administrators](users.qmd#data-management-administrators) add descriptions of the headers, it will be easier for others to understand what that header/column contains.
:::

Then, the user will have the option to click "Save and Submit Table", or to save a draft of the table.

At this user interface, missing fields will initially be highlighted in blue so the [Data Management Administrator](users.qmd#data-management-administrators)'s attention is led to these missing fields. They will only be able to continue, if no fields have missing values. If a user clicks "Save and Submit Table" without having filled in all fields, the missing fields will be highlighted in red.

### User Confirmation: Table Correctness

Then, when the validation is successful, Sprout will show the [Data Management Administrator](users.qmd#data-management-administrators) the final table for confirmation. This works as a user-driven check for *corretness*, i.e., is the table filled in correctly, rather than is the table complete, as the validation check before this step.

If the [Data Management Administrator](users.qmd#data-management-administrators) decides that the table is not correct, they will click "Edit Table", and they will be shown a user interface with the table where they can edit the headers, definitions, and add new fields if needed.

When the [Data Management Administrator](users.qmd#data-management-administrators) is satisfied with their adaptions, they click "Save and Submit Table". The table will then go through the validation check, "Table Completeness" again and if the validation is successful, Sprout will confirm: "New Table Added Successfully".

<!-- TODO: This description and the user flow diagram is not entirely identical. It needs further work. -->

### Continue to Data Upload or Quit?

Now, that the table has been created successfully, the [Data Management Administrator](users.qmd#data-management-administrators) has two options: Either they can "Continue to Data Upload", if they want to add data to the newly created table right after the table has been submitted, or they can choose to quit Sprout at this step, if they only wanted to create the table as preparation for future uploads.

![Diagram describing the next steps given after creating the table and passing the validation steps.](images/user-flow-table-created-continue-to-upload.png)

## Data Upload

There are two entry points for a user to upload data using an existing table. The first option is to continue from the diagram above, where the [Data Management Administrator](users.qmd#data-management-administrators) will upload data right after they have created a new table. In this option, they click "Continue to Data Upload" (left path of diagram below).

![Diagram showing the steps taken for uploading data when using an existing table.](images/user-flow-prepare-to-upload-using-existing-table.png)

The other option is the typical [Data Contributor](users.qmd#data-contributors) route where the user will enter Sprout, click "Upload Data", and then "Use Existing Table". Sprout will then show the user a list of existing tables to choose from and the user will select a table and select a file to upload. Then, they will click "Continue to Data Upload" (right path in the diagram above). 

After these steps, Sprout will initialise the data upload. This initialisation includes a validation check, *Table and Data Match*, as seen in the diagram below. At this step, Sprout checks whether the data and table match. If this validation fails, Sprout will show "Validation Failed" along with error messages where the system detects that the data does not match the table. 

The aim here is to show the user error messages that are as meaningful and helpful as possible. These messages should enable the user to go to their raw data and edit them to attempt to fix the errors. This step is, naturally, outside of Sprout (therefore, marked in blue in the diagram below). The user will then click "Upload Edited/New Version of File" and Sprout will show a user interface, where the user can add the new version of the file. When the user has selected the file and clicks "Upload File", the validation check runs again. 

If the validation fails, the loop with showing errors, user editing file outside of Sprout and uploading it again, will happen again. 

If validation succeeds, the data will be uploaded and Sprout will confirm: "Upload Successful".

## Entire User Flow

In the text and diagrams above, we have "chopped" the user flow of Sprout into five pieces and gone through each of them. In the diagram below, you can see the user flow in its entirety.
