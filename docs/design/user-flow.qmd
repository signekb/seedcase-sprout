{{< include ../_wip.qmd >}}

This document describes the user flow of Sprout. The user flow is split into five diagrams that go through the flow in more detail. At the end of the document, you can see the user flow of Sprout in its entirety.

In this document, we will mention different user roles. Go to the [Users](users.qmd) for definitions of user roles. 

## Initial Schema Creation 

The first step of uploading the data to Sprout is to create a *schema* for the data.

A **schema** in [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is a named collection of tables, views, sequences, and/or indices. The schemas in Sprout will only contain tables. 

<!--TODO Add link to PostgreSQL decision post, when Design documentation has been rendered to website: (as to why we use PostgreSQL, see the [PostgreSQL decision post](website link))-->

A schema includes:

- table names, 
- column names (*headers*), 
- descriptions (a sentence describe what the column contains), 
- data types, 
- whether the columns can contain NULL values, and 
- an optional reader-friendly title. 

Together, we call these the *schema definitions*, or simply *definitions*. In the table below, you can see an example of a schema named `data_resource` for a data resource that contains one table `table_1` with user information.

|schema |table | column-name | description | data-type | is-nullable | title (optional)
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `data_resource` | `table_1` | `user_id` | Unique ID identifying the user | `int` | 0 | NULL |
| `data_resource` | `table_1` | `last_name` | User's last name | `varchar` | 0 | NULL |
| `data_resource` | `table_1` | `first_name` | User's first name | `varchar` | 0 | NULL |
| `data_resource` | `table_1` | `email` | Unique ID identifying the user | `int` | 0 | NULL |
| `data_resource` | `table_1` | `address` | first address line of user's address | `varchar` | 1 | address line 1 |

: Example of schema named `data resource` with one table `table_1` with user information.

Users with the role [Data Management Administrators](users.qmd#data-management-administrators) are responsible for setting up these initial structures of the database. 

In Sprout, there are three ways to create schemas: 

- Create Schema from file
- Create Schema from Existing Schema
- Create Schema Manually

![Diagram of the flow that occurs when a new schema is created.](images/user-flow-schema-creation.png)

### Create Schema from File

The first option is to create a schema from a file. This workflow includes that the [Data Management Administrator](users.qmd#data-management-administrators) selects a file to upload and then clicks "Create Schema from File". Then, Sprout will extract the headers and definitions of the columns in the file. 

### Create Schema from Existing Schema 

The second option is to create a schema from an existing schema. This includes choosing an existing schema as a "base schema" for the [Data Management Administrator](users.qmd#data-management-administrators) to build a new schema from.

### Create Schema Manually

The third option is to create a schema manually. In this scenario, the [Data Management Administrator](users.qmd#data-management-administrators) will add headers and definitions of the schema manully. 

## Validation Check: Schema Completeness

When the initial schema has been created, Sprout will complete a validation check, "Schema Completeness". This check identifies whether all headers/column names have definitions. 

If there are missing fields (e.g., a column is missing a data type), the validation will fail. "Validation failed" will be shown on a user interface together with the schema. 

::: {.callout-note}
When a schema is created using a file, the *description* fields will initially be empty, since descriptions of headers are not within the file itself. By ensuring that [Data Management Administrators](users.qmd#data-management-administrators) add descriptions of the headers, it will be easier for others to understand what that header/column contains.
:::

Then, the user will have the option to click "Save and Submit Schema", or to save a draft of the schema.

At this user interface, missing fields will initially be highlighted in blue so the [Data Management Administrator](users.qmd#data-management-administrators)'s attention is led to these missing fields. They will only be able to continue, if no fields have missing values. If a user clicks "Save and Submit Schema" without having filled in all fields, the missing fields will be highlighted in red.

### User Confirmation: Schema Correctness

Then, when the validation is successful, Sprout will show the [Data Management Administrator](users.qmd#data-management-administrators) the final schema for confirmation. This works as a user-driven check for *corretness*, i.e., is the schema filled in correctly, rather than is the schema complete, as the validation check before this step.

If the [Data Management Administrator](users.qmd#data-management-administrators) decides that the schema is not correct, they will click "Edit Schema", and they will be shown a user interface with the schema where they can edit the headers, definitions, and add new fields if needed.

When the [Data Management Administrator](users.qmd#data-management-administrators) is satisfied with their adaptions, they click "Save and Submit Schema". The schema will then go through the validation check, "Schema Completeness" again and if the validation is successful, Sprout will confirm: "New Schema Added Successfully".

<!--TODO This description and the user flow diagram is not entirely identical. It needs further work. -->

### Continue to Data Upload or Quit?

Now, that the schema has been created successfully, the [Data Management Administrator](users.qmd#data-management-administrators) has two options: Either they can "Continue to Data Upload", if they want to add data to the newly created schema right after the schema has been submitted, or they can choose to quit Sprout at this step, if they only wanted to create the schema as preparation for future uploads.

![Diagram describing the next steps given after creating the schema and passing the validation steps.](images/user-flow-schema-created-continue-to-upload.png)

## Data Upload

There are two entry points for a user to upload data using an existing schema. The first option is to continue from the diagram above, where the [Data Management Administrator](users.qmd#data-management-administrators) will upload data right after they have created a new schema. In this option, they click "Continue to Data Upload" (left path of diagram below).

![Diagram showing the steps taken for uploading data when using an existing schema.](images/user-flow-prepare-to-upload-using-existing-schema.png)

The other option is the typical [Data Contributor](users.qmd#data-contributors) route where the user will enter Sprout, click "Upload Data", and then "Use Existing Schema". Sprout will then show the user a list of existing schemas to choose from and the user will select a schema and select a file to upload. Then, they will click "Continue to Data Upload" (right path in the diagram above). 

After these steps, Sprout will initialise the data upload. This initialisation includes a validation check, *Schema and Data Match*, as seen in the diagram below. At this step, Sprout checks whether the data and schema match. If this validation fails, Sprout will show "Validation Failed" along with error messages where the system detects that the data does not match the schema. 

The aim here is to show the user error messages that are as meaningful and helpful as possible. These messages should enable the user to go to their raw data and edit them to attempt to fix the errors. This step is, naturally, outside of Sprout (therefore, marked in blue in the diagram below). The user will then click "Upload Edited/New Version of File" and Sprout will show a user interface, where the user can add the new version of the file. When the user has selected the file and clicks "Upload File", the validation check runs again. 

If the validation fails, the loop with showing errors, user editing file outside of Sprout and uploading it again, will happen again. 

If validation succeeds, the data will be uploaded and Sprout will confirm: "Upload Successful".

## Entire User Flow

In the text and diagrams above, we have "chopped" the user flow of Sprout into five pieces and gone through each of them. In the diagram below, you can see the user flow in its entirety.

<!-- TODO: Update full user flow diagram to include all the other diagrams after review -->
