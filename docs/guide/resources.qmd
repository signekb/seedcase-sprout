In each [data package](/docs/design/interface/outputs.qmd) are [data
resources](/docs/design/interface/outputs.qmd), which contain a
conceptually standalone set of data. This page shows you how to create
and manage data resources inside a data package using Sprout. You will
need to have already [created a data package](packages.qmd).

{{< include _preamble.qmd >}}

::: callout-important
Data resources can only be created from [tidy
data](https://design.seedcase-project.org/data/). Before you can store
it, you need to process it into a tidy format, ideally using Python so
that you have a record of the steps taken to clean and transform the
data.
:::

Putting your raw data into a data package makes it easier for yourself
and others to use later one. So the steps you'll take to get your data
into the structure offered by Sprout are:

1.  Create the properties for the resource, using the original raw data
    as a starting point and edit as needed.
2.  Create a folder to store the (processed) data resource in your
    package, as well as having a folder for the (tidy) batch data.
3.  Save the properties of and path to the new data resource into the
    `datapackage.json` file.
4.  Re-build the data package's `README.md` file from the updated
    `datapackage.json` file.
5.  If you need to edit the properties at a later point, you can use
    `edit_resource_properties()` and then re-build the
    `datapackage.json` file.

```{python setup}
#| include: false
# This `setup` code chunk loads packages and prepares the data.
import seedcase_sprout.core as sp
from tempfile import mkdtemp
from pathlib import Path
from urllib.request import urlretrieve

temp_path = Path(mkdtemp())
package_path = temp_path / "diabetes-study"
package_path.mkdir()
sp.create_package_properties(
    properties=sp.example_package_properties(),
    path=package_path
)
readme = sp.as_readme_text(sp.example_package_properties())
sp.write_file(readme, package_path.parent)

# Since the path leads to the datapackage.json file, for later functions we need the folder instead.
package_path = package_path.parent

# TODO: Maybe eventually move this over into Sprout as an example dataset, rather than via a URL.
# Download the example data and save to a data-raw folder in the temp path.
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seedcase-project/data/refs/heads/main/patients/patients.csv"
raw_data_path = temp_path / "patients.csv"
urlretrieve(
    url,
    raw_data_path
)
```

Making a data resource requires that you have data that can be made into
a resource in the first place. Usually, generated or collected data
always starts out in a bit of a "raw" shape that needs some working.
This work needs to be done before adding the data as a data package,
since Sprout assumes that the data is already
[tidy](https://design.seedcase-project.org/data/). For this guide, we
use a raw (but fake) data file that is already tidy and that looks like:

```{python}
#| echo: false
with open(raw_data_path, "r") as f:
    print(f.read())
```

If you want to follow this guide with the same data, you can find it
[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seedcase-project/data/refs/heads/main/patients/patients.csv).
The path to this data, which is stored in a variable called
`raw_data_path`, is:

```{python}
#| echo: false
print(raw_data_path)
```

Before we start, you need to import Sprout as well as other helper
packages:

```{python}
import seedcase_sprout.core as sp

# For pretty printing of output
from pprint import pprint

# TODO: This could be a wrapper helper function instead
# To be able to write multiline strings without indentation
from textwrap import dedent
```

## Extract resource properties from raw data

You'll start by creating the resource's properties. Before you can have
data stored in a data package, it needs properties (i.e., metadata) on
the data. The resource's properties are what allow people to more easily
use the data in the data package, as well as being used to check that
the actual data matches the properties. While you can create a resource
properties object manually using `ResourceProperties`, it can be quite
intensive and time-consuming if you, for example, have many columns in
your data. To ease this process, you can extract as much information as
possible from the raw data to create an initial resource properties
object with `extract_resource_properties()`. Then, you can edit the
properties as needed.

Start with extracting the resource properties from the raw data. While
this function tries to infer the data types in the raw data, it might
not get it right. So, be sure to check the properties after using this
function. It can also not infer things that are not in the data itself,
like a description of what the data contains or the unit of the data.

```{python}
resource_properties = extract_resource_properties(
    data_path=raw_data_path
)
pprint(resource_properties)
```

You may be able to see that some things are missing, for instance, the
individual columns (called `fields`) don't have any descriptions. You
will have to manually add this yourself. You can run a check on the
properties to confirm what is missing:

```{python}
#| error: true
print(sp.check_resource_properties(resource_properties))
```

Time to fill in the description for all the fields in the resource:

```{python}
# TODO: Need to consider/design how editing can be done in an easier, user-friendly way.
# TODO: Add more detail when we know what can and can't be extracted.
# TODO: Set the path field here?
```

## Creating a data resource

Now that you have the properties for the resource, you can create the
resource itself within the data package. What this means is that you
will create a folder for the specific resource (since you may have more
data resources to add).

We assume you've already created a package (either by using the steps
from the [package guide](packages.qmd) or started making one for your
own data), with the path to the data package set as the variable
`package_path`:

```{python}
print(package_path)
```

Let's take a look at the current files and folders in the data package:

```{python}
#| echo: false
print(package_path.glob("**/*"))
```

This shows that the data package already includes a `datapackage.json`
file and a `README.md` file. Now you'll add the resource structure to
the package, using the helper function `path_resources()` to give the
correct path to the resources folder. The default behaviour of
`path_resources()` is to use the current working directory, but for this
guide you'll have to use the `path` argument to point to where the
package is stored in the temporary folder.

```{python}
# TODO: This doesn't work exactly as expected here. We need to create
# the `resources/` folder first.
sp.create_resource_structure(
    path=sp.path_resources(path=package_path)
)
```

The next step is to add the resource properties to the
`datapackage.json` file. Before they are added, they will be checked to
confirm that they are correctly filled in and that no required fields
are missing. You can use the `path_properties()` helper function to give
you the location to the `datapackage.json` path. Here, the `path`
argument points to the temporary folder where the package is stored.

```{python}
# TODO: This function needs to be updated to write to datapackage.json
sp.create_resource_properties(
    path=sp.path_properties(path=package_path),
    properties=resource_properties
)
```

::: callout-tip
If you want to see the list of resources available in your data package
via Python code (rather than looking at it directly in the file system),
you can use the `list_resources()` function.

```{python}
#| eval: false
# TODO: This could also be the `path_resources()` which lists the resources.
print(sp.list_resources(path=package_path))
```
:::

Let's check the contents of the `datapackage.json` file to see that the
resource properties have been added:

```{python}
pprint(sp.read_properties(sp.path_properties(path=package_path))
```

## Storing a backup of the raw data as a "batch" file

When you create a new data resource, or add data to an existing one,
Sprout has been designed to always store a backup of each time you add
new (or modified) data to a specific resource as a "batch" file. All the
batch data files are stored in a folder called `batch/` within the
resource's folder and is processed into the final Parquet data resource
file. This can be useful if you ever need to re-process the data at a
later point, troubleshoot any issues, update incorrect values, or if you
need to compare the stored batch data to your original raw data (before
it enters into the data resource).

As shown above, the data is stored in the path that we've set as
`raw_data_path`. Time to store this data in the resource's folder by
using:

```{python}
sp.write_resource_batch_data(
    data_path=raw_data_path,
    resource_properties=resource_properties
)
```

This function uses the properties object to determine where to store the
data as a batch file, which is in the `batch/` folder of the resource's
folder. You can check the newly added file by using:

```{python}
print(sp.path_resource_batch_files(1, path=package_path))
```

## Building the Parquet data resource file

Now that you've stored the data as a batch file, you can build the
Parquet file that will be used as the data resource. This Parquet file
is built from the all the data in the `batch/` folder. Since there is
only one batch data file stored in the resource's folder, only this one
will be used to build the data resource's parquet file:

```{python}
sp.build_resource_parquet(
    raw_files=sp.path_resource_batch_files(1, path=package_path),
    path=sp.path_resource_data(1, path=package_path)
)
```

::: callout-tip
If you add more raw data to the resource later on, you can update this
Parquet file to include all data in the batch folder using the
`build_resource_parquet()` function like shown above.
:::

## Re-building the README file

One of the last steps to adding a new data resource is to re-build the
`README.md` file for the data package. To allow some flexibility with
what gets added to the README text, this next function will only *build
the text*, but not write it to the file. This allows you to add
additional information to the README text before writing it to the file.

```{python}
readme_text = sp.as_readme_text(
    properties=sp.read_properties(sp.path_properties(path=package_path))
)
```

For this guide, you'll only use the default text and not add anything
else to it. Next you write the text to the `README.md` file by:

```{python}
sp.write_file(
    text=readme_text,
    path=sp.path_readme(path=package_path)
)
```

## Edit resource properties

After having created a resource, you may need to make edits to the
properties. While technically you can do this manually by opening up the
`datapackage.json` file and editing it, we've strongly recommend you use
the functions to do this. These functions help to ensure that the
`datapackage.json` is still in a correct JSON format and have the
correct fields filled in. Using the `edit_resource_properties()`
function, you give it the path to the current properties and then create
a new `ResourceProperties` object with the changes you want to make.
Anything in the new properties object will overwrite fields in the old
properties object. This function does not write back, it only returns
the new properties object.

```{python}
resource_properties = sp.edit_resource_properties(
    path=sp.path_properties(path=package_path),
    properties=sp.ResourceProperties(
        title="Basic characteristics of patients"
    )
)
pprint(resource_properties)
```

To write back, use the `write_resource_properties()` function:

```{python}
sp.write_resource_properties(
    properties=resource_properties,
    path=sp.path_properties(path=package_path)
)
```

```{python}
#| include: false
temp_path.cleanup()
```
