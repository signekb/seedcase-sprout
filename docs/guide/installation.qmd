We designed Sprout to be installed for use either on your own computer
(locally) or on a server (remote). This guide will walk you through
installing Sprout. Regardless of how you install Sprout, you will need
to use the Terminal.

{{< include _preamble.qmd >}}

Before installing Sprout in either a virtual environment or system-wide,
you need the following:

-   [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version \>=3.12
-   [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/latest/installation/) version \>=1.7.1

To check that you've installed these programs, run these commands in the
Terminal to check their versions:

``` bash
python3 --version
pipx --version
```

## Use in a project in a virtual environment

To install into a project, you can use any package dependency manager.
For this guide, we will use Poetry:

-   [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/main/#installing-with-pipx)
    version \>=1.8

To check that you've installed these programs, run these commands in the
Terminal to check their versions:

``` bash
poetry --version
```

### Creating a virtual environment

Python packages are generally recommended to be installed in a virtual
environment. This is a way to isolate the packages you install for a
specific project from the global system. To make this virtual
environment, we need to create it with Poetry in any folder on the
computer. A good location might be in your Documents folder or Desktop.
For now, we will create it on the desktop:

``` bash
cd Desktop
poetry new use-sprout
cd use-sprout
```

You're now ready to install Sprout!

### Install Sprout

We can install Sprout directly from the [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/seedcase-project/seedcase-sprout) by
running the following command:

``` bash
poetry add "git+https://github.com/seedcase-project/seedcase-sprout.git"
```

To check that Sprout has been installed correctly, run the following
command in your terminal:

``` bash
poetry show seedcase_sprout
```

If it installed successfully, it will show details about Sprout.

Get started with your first data package by following the guide on
[Creating and managing data packages](/docs/guide/packages.qmd).

## Use anywhere on the computer or in the Terminal

Rather than installing Sprout in a virtual environment, you can install
it system-wide. This means you can use Sprout from any folder on your
computer or in the Terminal. The easiest way to do this is to use pipx.

``` bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/seedcase-project/seedcase-sprout.git
```

To check that Sprout has been installed correctly, run the following:

``` bash
pipx show seedcase_sprout
```

Now you can use `seedcase_sprout` in any Python script throughout your
computer.
