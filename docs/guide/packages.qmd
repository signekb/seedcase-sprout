title: "Creating and managing data packages"

At the core of Sprout is the [data
package](/docs/design/implementation/outputs.qmd), which is a
standardized way of structuring and sharing data. This guide will show
you how to create and manage data packages using Sprout.

<!-- TODO: this callout might need to be its own include, since other docs will use it too -->

::: callout-important
For both the Python library and the CLI, Sprout assumes you have full
control over the folders and files of the system, or at least your
user's home directory. This includes being given space on a server that
mostly has access through a Terminal, where you have control over the
directories you can write to.

An easy example of this is if you install Sprout on your own computer
because you want to create some data packages for research studies you
are running. Another example would be if your research group has storage
space on a server that you need to use a Terminal and SSH to be able to
access.

## Creating a data package

::::: panel-tabset
### Python

The first thing you'll need to decide is where you want to store your
data packages. By default, Sprout will create it in
`~/sprout/packages/` on Linux (see
[Outputs](/docs/design/implementation/outputs.qmd) for operating system
specific locations), but you can change this by setting the
`SPROUT_ROOT` environment variable. For instance, maybe you want the
location to be `~/Documents/data-packages/`. You can set this in your
Python script like so:

``` python
import sprout.core as sp
import os

os.environ["SPROUT_ROOT"] = "~/Documents/data-packages/"
```

Afterwards, you can create the structure for your first data package by
using:

``` python
sp.create_package_structure(path=sp.path_packages())
```

```
[PosixPath('~/Documents/data-packages/1/datapackage.json'),
 PosixPath('~/Documents/data-packages/1/README.md')]
```

This creates the initial structure of your new package with the ID `1`.
The output above shows that the folder of your data package `1` has been
created. This folder consists of two files: `datapackage.json` and
`README.md`. The `datapackage.json` file initially contains fields with
some default values in them, but it will eventually contain the
metadata, a.k.a. the `properties`, of your data package. `README.md` is
a prettified, human-readable version of the content of the
`datapackage.json`.

While you *can* manually fill in the details in the `datapackage.json`
file, we have several helper classes, such as `PackageProperties`, `LicenseProperties`, and `ContributorProperties`, to make it easier for you.

``` python
properties = sp.PackageProperties(
    title="Diabetes and Hypertension Study",
    description="Data from the 2021 study on diabetes and hypertension",
    contributors=[sp.ContributorProperties(
        title="Jamie Jones",
        email="jamie_jones@example.com",
        roles=["creator"]
    )],
    licenses=[sp.LicensesProperties("ODC-BY-1.0")]
)
print(properties)
```

```
# TODO: This will eventually show the actual output.
PackageProperties(...)
```

Then, to update the current `datapackage.json` file with these properties, you can use the `update_package_properties()` function:

``` python
package_properties = sp.update_package_properties(
  path=sp.path_properties(package_id=1),
  properties=properties
)
print(package_properties)
```

```
# TODO: add an example output of the above.
{...}
```

::: callout-important
The `update_package_properties()` function will give an error if the
required fields are not filled in to create a valid `datapackage.json` file.
:::

To save the package properties to the `datapackage.json` file, run:

``` python
sp.write_package_properties(
  properties=package_properties,
  path=sp.path_properties(package_id=1)
)
```

If you need help with filling in the right properties, see the
documentation for the `PackageProperties` classes or run
e.g., `print(sp.PackageProperties())` to get a list of all the fields you can
fill in for a package.

You now have the basic starting point for adding data resources to your
data package.

### CLI

The CLI is a bit more straightforward as long as you are comfortable
using the Terminal. You can set the `SPROUT_ROOT` environment variable
to change the location of the data packages. For instance, maybe you
want the location to be `~/Documents/data-packages/`. You can set this
in your terminal like so:

``` bash
export SPROUT_ROOT=~/Documents/data-packages/
```

Then creating a new package would be as simple as:

``` bash
sprout package create
```

This will prompt you for some required fields you need to fill in, like
the title and description of the data package. If you want to skip the
prompt, you can provide the information directly in the command:

``` bash
sprout package create \
  --title "Diabetes and Hypertension Study" \
  --description "Data from the 2021 study on diabetes and hypertension"
```

This creates the initial structure of your new package with the ID `1`.
The output above shows that the folder of your data package `1` has been
created. This folder consists of two files: `datapackage.json` and
`README.md`. The `datapackage.json` file is empty initially, but it will
contain the metadata, a.k.a. the `properties`, of your data package.
`README.md` is a prettified, human-readable version of the content of
the `datapackage.json`.

You now have the basic starting point for adding data resources to your
data package in the location you specified:

```
~/Documents/data-packages/1/datapackage.json
~/Documents/data-packages/1/README.md
```
