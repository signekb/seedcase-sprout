    """Reads all the batch resource file(s) into a list of (Polars) DataFrames.

    This function takes the Parquet file(s) given by `paths`, reads them in as Polars
    DataFrames as a list and does some checks on each of the DataFrames in the list
    based on the `resource_properties`. The `resource_properties` object is used
    to check the data and ensure it is correct. While Sprout generally assumes
    that the files stored in the `resources/<id>/batch/` folder are already
    correctly structured and tidy, this function still runs checks to ensure the
    data are correct by comparing to the properties.

    Args:
        resource_properties: The `ResourceProperties` object that contains the
            properties of the resource you want to check the data against.
        paths: A list of paths for all the files in the resource's `batch/` folder.
            Use `path_resource_batch_files()` to help provide the correct paths to the
            batch files. Defaults to the batch files of the given resource.

    Returns:
        Outputs a list of DataFrame objects from all the batch files.

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If a file in the list of paths doesn't exist.
        ValueError: If the batch file name is not in the expected pattern.
        ValueError: If the timestamp column name matches an existing column in the
            DataFrame.
