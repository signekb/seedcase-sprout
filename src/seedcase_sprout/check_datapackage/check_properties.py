    Both package and resource properties are checked. Structural, type and format

    collected before errors are returned.

    The schema loaded or constructed in this function overrides any values specified
    in the `$schema` attribute of `properties`, including the default value.

        properties: The full package properties to check, including resource properties.
        check_recommendations: Whether `properties` should be checked against
            recommendations in the Data Package standard in addition to requirements.
