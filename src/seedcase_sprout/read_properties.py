    """Read in the properties from the `datapackage.json` file.

    Reads the `datapackage.json` file, checks that it is correct, and then
    outputs a `PackageProperties` object.

    Args:
        path: The path to the `datapackage.json` file. Use `PackagePath().properties()`
            to help get the correct path. If no path is provided, this function looks
            for the `datapackage.json` file in the current working directory.

    Returns:
        Outputs a `PackageProperties` object with the properties from the
            `datapackage.json` file.

    Examples:
        ```{python}
        import seedcase_sprout as sp

        with sp.ExamplePackage():
            sp.read_properties()
        ```

    Raises:
        FileNotFound: If the `datapackage.json` file doesn't exist.
        JSONDecodeError: If the `datapackage.json` file couldn't be read.
